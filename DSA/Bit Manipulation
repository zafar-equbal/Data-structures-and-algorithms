Bit manipulation in Java involves using bitwise and bit shift operators to directly manipulate individual bits within integral data types (like int, long, short, byte, and char). 
This technique is used for optimization, low-level programming, and solving certain algorithmic problems efficiently. 

Bitwise Operators in Java :

Java provides a set of operators for bit-level operations: 
Bitwise AND (&): Compares corresponding bits of two operands; if both are 1, the result is 1, otherwise 0.
Bitwise OR (|): Compares corresponding bits; if at least one is 1, the result is 1, otherwise 0.
Bitwise XOR (^): Compares corresponding bits; if the bits are different, the result is 1, otherwise 0.
Bitwise NOT (~): A unary operator that inverts all the bits of a single operand (changes 0 to 1 and 1 to 0). 


Bit Shift Operators :

These operators shift the bits of a number to the left or right: 
Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions, filling the rightmost positions with zeros.
This is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.
Signed Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right, preserving the sign of the number by filling the leftmost positions with the sign bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative). 
This is equivalent to integer division by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.
Unsigned Right Shift (>>>): Shifts bits to the right, always filling the leftmost positions with zeros, regardless of the original sign.

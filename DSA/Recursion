Recursion : Recursion in Java is a programming technique where a method repeatedly calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, identical subproblems.

Key Concepts : 

Recursive Method: A function in Java that calls itself.

Base Case: A condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a StackOverflowError.

Recursive Step (or Case): The part of the method that makes the recursive call with a modified input that moves closer to the base case.

Call Stack: Each time a method is called, a new stack frame (a block of memory) is created on the call stack to store its local variables and parameters.
When the base case is reached and the method returns, its frame is popped off the stack. 

// program to calculate factorial 

public class Factorial {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        // Base case: Stop when n is 0
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive step: Call the method again with a smaller input
        else {
            return n * factorial(n - 1);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 5;
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + num + " is: " + factorial(num)); // Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120
    }
}

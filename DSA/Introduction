DSA - DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms.

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.
Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

Key Aspects of DSA:
===================================================================================================================================================================
Data Structures: Specialized methods for storing and organizing data to use it effectively (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues).

Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems (e.g., Sorting: QuickSort, MergeSort; Searching: Binary Search).

Purpose: To write code that runs faster and consumes less memory, which is crucial for high-performance applications like AI, navigation, and gaming.

Importance: It is highly valued in job interviews for top tech companies (Google, Amazon, Meta) and helps build scalable software.

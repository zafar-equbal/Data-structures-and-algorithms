Encapsulation : The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users.

To achieve this, you must:
declare class variables/attributes as private
provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable


Real-time Example: A Bank Account System
A BankAccount class demonstrates encapsulation by protecting the balance data.
It uses a private field for the balance and public methods for controlled, validated interaction.

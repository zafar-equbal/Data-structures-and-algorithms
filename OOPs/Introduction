Object-oriented programming (OOP or OOPs) is a paradigm based on "objects" that contain data (fields) and code (methods).

It organizes software design around data rather than functions, improving reusability, maintainability, and structure. 

Core concepts include classes (blueprints), objects (instances), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 


==================================================================================================================================================================================
Key Concepts of OOPs:

Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects, defining attributes and behaviors.

Object: An instance of a class, representing a specific, concrete entity.

Encapsulation: Binding data and methods together, restricting direct access to some components.

Inheritance: A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class.

Polymorphism: The ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in their own way.

Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features. 


==================================================================================================================================================================================
Advantages of OOP:

Reusability: Code can be reused through inheritance.

Maintainability: Easier to maintain, modify, and debug code.

Structure: Provides a clear, modular structure.

Real-world Modeling: Models real-world entities better than procedural programming. 

Common languages that support OOP include Java, Python, C++, C#, and JavaScript.

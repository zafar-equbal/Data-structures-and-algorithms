Object: In Java, an object is a fundamental, real-world entity and a core building block of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

It is an instance of a class that combines both data (state) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. 

============================================================================================================================================================================
Key Characteristics of an Object:

Every object has three primary characteristics: 

<i>   State: The data or attributes of an object, represented by fields or variables.
      For example, a Car object's state might include its color, brand, and speed.

<ii>  Behavior: The actions an object can perform, defined by its methods.
      A Car object's behaviors could include drive(), brake(), or accelerate().

<iii> Identity: A unique identifier that distinguishes one object from all others, even if they have the same state and behavior.
      The Java runtime uses this internally to manage objects in memory.

Creating an Object in Java :
Objects are typically created using the ( new ) keyword, which allocates memory and calls a constructor to initialize the object's state.

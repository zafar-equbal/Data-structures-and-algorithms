Method Overloading - Method overloading is an object-oriented programming feature allowing a class to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number, type, or order).
It increases code readability and reusability, serving as compile-time polymorphism where the compiler determines the specific method to execute based on the signature.


Key Rules :
1. Same Name, Different Parameters: Methods must share the same name but have a unique parameter list (signature).
2. Return Type Doesn't Matter: The return type can be the same or different, but changing only the return type is not enough to overload a method; the parameter list must still be different.
3. Access Modifier Doesn't Matter: The access modifier can also be different for overloaded methods. 

Example of method overloading :

1. Overloading by Changing the Number of Parameters
This is achieved by defining methods with the same name but different counts of arguments. 

Syntax : public class Calculator {

    // Method with two parameters
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method with three parameters
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println("Sum of 2 numbers: " + calc.add(10, 20)); // Calls the first method
        System.out.println("Sum of 3 numbers: " + calc.add(10, 20, 30)); // Calls the second method
    }
}

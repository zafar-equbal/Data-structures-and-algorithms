Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) that describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms.
In computer science, polymorphism describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.
Each type can provide its own independent implementation of this interface.

In programming language theory and type theory, polymorphism allows a value or variable to have more than one type and allows a given operation to be performed on values of more than one type.

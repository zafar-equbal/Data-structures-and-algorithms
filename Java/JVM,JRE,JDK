JVM : The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables computers to run Java bytecode, acting as an interpreter between Java programs and the underlying hardware. 
It provides a platform-independent runtime environment, allowing Java applications to run on any device without modification.
Key functions include bytecode conversion, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, automatic memory management, and garbage collection. 

Core Components and Functions :
Bytecode Execution: The JVM interprets or compiles Java bytecode into machine-specific code.
Memory Management: The JVM manages memory, including garbage collection to remove unused objects and prevent memory leaks.
JIT Compiler: The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler optimizes performance by compiling frequently executed bytecode into native machine code at runtime.
Platform Independence: The JVM allows "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), ensuring applications run on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

JRE : The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a software package required to run Java applications, containing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core libraries, and other components. 
It acts as a layer on top of the operating system, providing the necessary environment to execute compiled Java bytecode. 

Key Aspects of JRE :
Purpose: Enables end-users to run Java applications (desktop/laptop).
Components: Contains the JVM, class loaders, and class libraries (e.g., Java API).
Platform Independence: Allows Java code to run on any system by converting bytecode into machine-specific instructions.
Relationship to JDK: JRE is a part of the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is used for developing Java software.
Installation: Installed on systems to run Java applications (typically in C:\Program Files\Java\jre on Windows).

JVM : The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables computers to run Java bytecode, acting as an interpreter between Java programs and the underlying hardware. 
It provides a platform-independent runtime environment, allowing Java applications to run on any device without modification.
Key functions include bytecode conversion, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, automatic memory management, and garbage collection. 

Core Components and Functions :
Bytecode Execution: The JVM interprets or compiles Java bytecode into machine-specific code.
Memory Management: The JVM manages memory, including garbage collection to remove unused objects and prevent memory leaks.
JIT Compiler: The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler optimizes performance by compiling frequently executed bytecode into native machine code at runtime.
Platform Independence: The JVM allows "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), ensuring applications run on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

JRE : The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a software package required to run Java applications, containing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core libraries, and other components. 
It acts as a layer on top of the operating system, providing the necessary environment to execute compiled Java bytecode. 

Key Aspects of JRE :
Purpose: Enables end-users to run Java applications (desktop/laptop).
Components: Contains the JVM, class loaders, and class libraries (e.g., Java API).
Platform Independence: Allows Java code to run on any system by converting bytecode into machine-specific instructions.
Relationship to JDK: JRE is a part of the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is used for developing Java software.
Installation: Installed on systems to run Java applications (typically in C:\Program Files\Java\jre on Windows).

==========================================================================================================================================================================================

JDK : The JDK stands for the Java Development Kit, which is a comprehensive software package that provides all the tools, libraries, and environments necessary to write, compile, debug, and run Java applications.
It is the foundational component for Java programmers. 

Core Components :
The JDK is a superset that includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and additional development tools. 

Development Tools: These are command-line utilities for developers, including:
javac: The Java compiler that translates Java source code (.java files) into platform-independent bytecode (.class files).
java: The application launcher (interpreter) that starts the JVM and executes the bytecode.
jar: The archiver tool used to package related class libraries and resources into a single Java Archive (.jar) file for easy distribution.
javadoc: The documentation generator that automatically creates HTML API documentation from comments in the source code.
jdb: The Java Debugger, a command-line utility for finding and fixing bugs.
Java Runtime Environment (JRE): The JRE provides the environment needed to run Java programs. It contains:
Java Virtual Machine (JVM): An abstract machine that executes Java bytecode, managing memory and ensuring Java's "write once, run anywhere" capability by translating bytecode into the host machine's specific instructions.
Core Class Libraries: Pre-written code that provides essential functionalities (e.g., handling data structures, networking, security). 

Summary of Relationship
JDK = JRE + Development Tools
JRE = JVM + Core Libraries
JVM = The runtime engine that executes the bytecode

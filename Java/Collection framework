Collection :
Java, a collection is an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit, 
providing a unified architecture (the Collections Framework) to store, manipulate, and retrieve groups of objects. 
This framework, located in the java.util package, offers reusable data structures and algorithms, which overcome the limitations of traditional arrays like fixed size.

Java is an object oriented programming language developed by sun microsystem in 1991.

It was originally called Oak by James Goslin.

Object-Oriented : Java is a pure object-oriented language, meaning it structures programs around data and objects, utilizing principles like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. This approach promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

Platform Independence : Java code is compiled into an intermediate format called bytecode, which does not depend on a specific operating system or hardware architecture. This bytecode is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing the same compiled program to run on any device with a compatible JVM installed (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).

Simple Java was designed to be easy to learn and use. It removes complex and error-prone features found in languages like C++, such as explicit pointers, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance.

Robust : Java emphasizes reliability through strong memory management, early compile-time error checking, and a robust exception-handling mechanism that helps deal with unexpected problems smoothly at runtime.

Secure The language includes built-in security features, such as running programs in a virtual "sandbox" environment (the JVM), a bytecode verifier, and a security manager. These features protect the host system from unauthorized access and potential threats.

Multithreaded Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple parts of a program to run concurrently. This is especially important for interactive applications and servers that need to handle many tasks or client requests simultaneously, maximizing CPU efficiency.

Automatic Garbage Collection : Java's memory management is automatically handled by the JVM's garbage collector, which reclaims memory from objects that

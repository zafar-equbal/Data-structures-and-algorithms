do- while loop --> The Java do-while loop executes a block of code at least once, and then continues to repeat as long as a specified condition remains true.
  It is known as an exit-controlled loop because the condition is checked after the loop body executes.

  
Syntax :
The syntax for the do-while loop is as follows:
  
do {
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);

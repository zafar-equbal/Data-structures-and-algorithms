Generics in Java provide a way to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety and code reusability. 
Introduced in Java 5, generics eliminate the need for explicit type casting and help in catching type mismatch errors during compilation rather than at runtime.

Why Use Generics?

The primary benefits of using generics include:
Type Safety: The compiler performs strong type checks on generic code, ensuring that only objects of the specified type are stored, which prevents ClassCastException errors at runtime.
Code Reusability: Developers can write a single class or method declaration that works with different data types, rather than writing a separate class for each type.
Cleaner Code: Generics eliminate the need for manual type casting when retrieving objects from a generic collection, making the code more readable.

Key Concepts
Type Parameters: Generics use type parameters, which are placeholders for actual types. By convention, these are single, uppercase letters such as:
E - Element (used in the Java Collections Framework)
K - Key (used in Maps)
T - Type (for general use)
V - Value (used in Maps)

Generic Classes: A class can be declared with one or more type parameters.
java
// Example of a generic class with a single type parameter T
public class Box<T> {
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}

// Usage
Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>(); // T becomes Integer
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();   // T becomes String
==============================================================================================================================================================================

Generic Methods: A method can declare its own type parameters, allowing it to be called with arguments of different types.
java
// Example of a generic method
public static <T> void printArray(T[] elements) {
    for (T element : elements) {
        System.out.println(element);
    }
}

Keywords in Java are predefined, reserved words that have specific meanings to the compiler and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable, method, or class names).
They are fundamental building blocks for the language's syntax and logic. 

As of recent Java versions, there are 52 fully reserved keywords, two of which (const and goto) are unused.
There are also several contextual keywords that have special meaning only in specific situations (e.g., var, yield, record, sealed, and non-sealed).
The values true, false, and null are also reserved, but are technically literals, not keywords.

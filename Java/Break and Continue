break Statement - The break statement is used to immediately terminate the current loop (or switch statement) and transfer program control to the statement immediately following the loop. 
It acts as an emergency exit from the entire loop. 

Usage: Can be used with for, while, do-while, and switch statements.

Behavior in Nested Loops: When used within nested loops, break terminates only the innermost loop in which it is located.

Syntax: break; 

Example :
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
              if (i == 5) {
               break; // Loop terminates when i is 5
          }
              System.out.println("i: " + i);
       }
         // Execution continues here after the break

continue Statement - The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.
It bypasses any remaining code in the loop body for that specific iteration. 

Usage: Can be used with for, while, and do-while loops. It cannot be used with the switch statement.

Behavior in Nested Loops: Similar to break, continue only affects the current iteration of the innermost loop it is in.

Syntax: continue; 

Example:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        continue; // Skips the rest of the loop body for even numbers
    }
    System.out.println("Odd number: " + i);
}
// The loop continues with the next iteration

While loop - It is also a loop used for specific condition in which we do not have idea to how much the iteration will be.
It iterate till the condition is true if the condition is false it break.


Syntax for while loop 

public class Main{
public static void main(String args []){
   int i=0;
   while(i<5){
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
   }
 }
}

How it Works
Initialization: A loop control variable is typically initialized before the loop starts.
Condition Check: The boolean condition is evaluated.
Execution:
If the condition is true, the code inside the loop body is executed.
If the condition is false, the loop terminates, and program control moves to the next statement after the loop.
Update: An update expression (e.g., incrementing or decrementing a counter) within the loop body modifies the variable used in the condition, which is crucial for the loop to eventually terminate.
Without it, an infinite loop may occur.
Repeat: The process returns to step 2 (Condition Check).

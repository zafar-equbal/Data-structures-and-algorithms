Java Booleans : Very often in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:
YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE
For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can store true or false values.

declaration :A boolean type is declared with the boolean keyword and can only take the values true or false.

Example:
boolean isJavaFun = true;
boolean isFishTasty = false;

System.out.println(isJavaFun);    // Outputs true
System.out.println(isFishTasty);  // Outputs false
